## I'm a machine learning engineer and also __Critical thinker__




  
My programming background is from my high school when I started programming in C and C++. Back in those days, I was a member of a Soccer 2D Simulation team. That time I got familiar with object-oriented programming, decision-making rules, and some of the _intelligent algorithms_ and those things drove me to be a curious guy and I have been following my curiosities with programming in __Python__.





    
<h2> üë®‚Äçüéìüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me üíºüéí: </h2>
I'm looking for a PhD posiotion in machine learning fields. In my M.Sc. studies, due to my extreme passion for learning about computer vision and combining
the developments of this area with the study of different defects in industrial elements, I took courses such as ‚ÄúNeural Networks‚Äù, ‚ÄúPattern Recognition‚Äù, ‚ÄúEstimation Theory‚Äù, ‚ÄúInformation Theory‚Äù, and ‚ÄúImage Processing‚Äù.
With over +5 of experience in machine learning, I have developed a strong skill set in using machine learning techniques to solve complex and real problems. My extensive experience in Deep Learning, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing, Domain Adaptation, and more has allowed me to successfully complete projects such as unsupervised learning, object detection, classification, localization, segmentation, remote sensing, CNN, Faster-RCNN, YOLO, OCR,  progressive image transmission, time-series prediction data like, EEG,ECG , EMG, and feature fusion.
